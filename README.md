# Project 'application1'

This is a simple spring-boot based project used for interacting
with several infrastructure components, especially the database.

### Disclaimer

There are probably lots of bad coding practices done in this project.
Please be lenient : the purpose it not to show how to code a spring
boot application nor how to perform software craftsmanship. It's just
to have a simple running application for further tests ;)

I decline all responsibility if you copy/paste anything into your
production code.
